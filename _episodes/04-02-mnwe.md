> ## Parallel the shell commands ways
> 
> As illustrated above, we can use shell commands to search for the Pi estimates. With the
> [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) tool we can parallelise shell commands. 
> The `parallel` command takes a list of inputs and starts a command for each. Lola creates a 
> shell script `parallel_search.sh` to search for Pi estimates:
>
> ~~~~~
> {% include /snippets/03/submit_parallel_pi_search.{{ site.workshop_scheduler }} %}
> ~~~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> In this script, `parallel` starts a job for each of the CPUs reserved by the scheduler. The command
> contains a *wildcard*, `{}`, into which is substituted by the filenames from the `ls` command. 
>
> In addition to starting many jobs on a single machine, the `parallel` command is also able to use
> multiple machines, with jobs distributed using `ssh`. Here is an updated `parallel_search.sh` 
> script with multi-machine support.
